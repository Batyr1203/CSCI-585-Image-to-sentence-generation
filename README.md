# CSCI-585-Image-to-sentence-generation
Spring23, Computer Vision Course term project on Image Captioning

This repository consists of models presented as a term project.

Term project presents 2 models that are composed of a Convolutional Network at the encoding step, and different variants of language model: Recurrent Network one and Transformer based one. We utilized three common datasets for this task: MSCOCO, Flickr8K, FLickr30K, and evaluated the performance with BLEU metrics.
